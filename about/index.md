Hello, I'm Tejas Suthar from India - Ahmedabad. 

This is my personal bog where I write my views related to web and mobile application development. I like to write what I've experienced during my web development carrier. 

I've earned Masters degree in Communication & Information Technology (M.Sc. CA & IT), and having vast experience building Web & Mobile Applications since 2010. Currently working at well known MNC company as a Lead Laravel/AngularJS Developer Lead.

I always believe that information and learning on web should always be open and interactive and people find it easy to adopt that information in their reallife with the help of different cutting edge technological improvement. That is the reason I choose the Open Source technology (PHP) and its related develpoment carrier path.

Choose Opensource technologies and development as a carrier path. 

I always believe that information and learning on web should always be open and interactive and people find it easy to adopt that information in their reallife with the help of different cutting edge technological improvement. That is the reason I choose the Open Source technology (PHP) and its related develpoment carrier path. Here is my carrier history and it related information about my employment and positions along with duraiton. 


## Web Developer (July 2009 - Aug 2010)
I started my carrier as a Junior Developer at Ahmedabad, worked on e-commerce apps based on framework *zencart*. Which is almost outdated as of now. I also learned [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/project/framework) and creaded in-house modules. Also company has very good flow of new freshers coming and there were huge chellange of taking interviews for all of them everyday. I suggested solution to this problem to company CEO and build a Interactive [JQuery](https://jquery.com/) - fancy ;) enabled *Quiz Application* in *Drupal 5*. Whoever the candidate is coming has to pass the basic PHP quiz and then they are being available with second round of Interview. Also build couple inhouse Drupal modules and work with *Flex* & *Drupal Services* Integration.


## Technical Leader (June 2010 - Nov 2010)
My roles and responsibilities were to assign tasks based on the client project requirement and execute project from initial phase to sign off phase. During this period I worked with team of 3 developers and executed Zencart, Drupal Projects. Also learned a bit of [Magento](http://www.magento.com) during my availale time in weekend.

## PHP Software Engineer (Dec 2010 - April 2012)
I joined India/US based company at Ahmedabad and worked on core PHP web applications along with Prestashop e-commerce development. During this time, I was freely available at home and thought let's create some Prestashop Add-on to kill my weekend time and also learn the Prestashop e-commerce framework. Then I started working on building extensions. Also release one XML Sitemaps prestashop (My First commercial Prestashop Add-on). 

The price of that Prestashop Addon was $132 and at first I didn't thought to get sale of that addon. I was busy in my job working there and suddenly after 2 week, I got mail form my gmail inbox that one of your module has been sold to couple of customers and your wallet balance is USD XXX - I was delighted to know that my Addon get a sale and since then during a span of a year, I made 10 Prestashop Addons and few of them sold more that 15 times and couple of them got discontinued and I didn't get much time to maintain the new version compatibility. 


## Team Lead (Apr 2012 - Present)
After leaving previous company, I was wanted to build something other in the field of mobile technology. Then in that time probably around 2015-16, I found that the market of Android Application Development got crazy and wanted to buid something that can increase my income, I immediately decide to build Android Apps and started learning concepts of core JAVA - as we did JAVA in our college duration, but it was just like normal reading and program executino. I practice a lot Java and then started building Andorid Applications. Meanwhile, one of my neighbour jounior friend was passed ouf form MCA and also started to build something like me. He approached to me and we started working. 

Initially we were not that much focused to build something very serious. But just trying our hand out to build that is very easy to deploy to Andorid App Market and then see how its working. Same as every time, I though its pretty worthless to work with this mobile technology and keep doing what we were doing. Within couple of week we shipped our first Andorid Application. Also market it in our Facebook community and got good normal response. After couple of other apps development, our app market account good visibility and we got few dollars in our account. Believe me, It felt really awesome to get initial amount.

After those couple of App builds, we were confident enough to get more out of our applications and we invest our time and money in marketing those tiny little apps and they really paid what we spent it for. Same way, we build more than 15 applications and earned significiant amount of Money out of Android Applications Development in our weekends. I saw that building Native Android Applications is very time consuming and difficult in terms of various vendors coming into the market - as you have to be compitible with all the devices to get enough visiblity. 

Recently, I switched over to [Hybrid Application Development](https://www.sitepoint.com/native-vs-hybrid-app-development/) with [Ionic Framework](http://http://ionicframework.com/). Its pretty awesome framework and the most important is that I can build Android Applications with other Client side framework like [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org). As all in developer community know, [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org) doesn't need introduction. Now I can create Mobile Applications with the web technologies we love. 


Apart form this Andoroid Applications, currently I'm workining in well known MNC at Ahmedabad. During last 4 years at this company, I learned a lot about other MVC frameworks like CodeIgniter, Laravel, Yii and developed many mision critical webservices and deliver excellend products to premium customers. Also solved very critical problem of Gigabit XML parsing, Apache Solr Server Setup, [Amazon Stack](https://aws.amazon.com) (S3, EC2, SES, SNS), [Twilio Voice/Video Calling](https://www.twilio.com/video), [Twilio SMS Integration](https://www.twilio.com/SMS), [Twilio IVR Systems Development & Integration](https://www.twilio.com/docs/tutorials/walkthrough/ivr-phone-tree/php/laravel) and client side framework like [JQuery](https://jquery.com/), [AngularJs](https://angularjs.org). Streaming build system like [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com), [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com).
